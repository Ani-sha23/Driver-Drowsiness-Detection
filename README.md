# 🚗Driver Drowsiness & Distraction Detection System

A real-time AI-based system that detects **driver drowsiness and distraction** using computer vision and deep learning.  
This system helps prevent road accidents by monitoring eye movement, blinking rate, yawning, and head orientation.

## Project Overview

Driver fatigue and distraction are among the leading causes of road accidents worldwide.  
This project uses a **webcam and deep learning models** to continuously monitor the driver and trigger alerts when signs of fatigue or distraction are detected.

The system works in real-time and can be deployed in cars, simulators, or monitoring systems.
